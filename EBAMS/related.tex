\subsection{Previous work by the NDN team}

This network environment continues work that began in the original NDN project on authenticated lighting control and was extended through an EAGER in 2012-2013 to explore sensing and building management.  The current and ongoing research, its results, and our evolving testbed are described in Section~\ref{sec:instrumented}.
