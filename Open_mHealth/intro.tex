\section{Introduction}

As part of the NSF-supported NDN ``Next Phase'' research from 2014-2016, 
the NDN project team has selected two network environments, {\bf Open mHealth} and {\bf
Enterprise Building Automation \& Management}, and one application
cluster, {\bf Mobile Multimedia}, to drive our research, verify the
architecture design, and ground evaluation of the next phase of our project.
The two environments represent critical areas in the design space for
next-generation Health IT and Cyberphysical Systems, respectively.  They
also extend work started in the previous NDN FIA project on participatory
sensing and instrumented environments to focus on specific application
ecosystems where we believe NDN can address fundamental challenges that
are unmet by IP.  Based on the successful initial results of previous
NDN research, we have identified Mobile  Multimedia as an application
area of cross-cutting relevance, motivated not only by the
network environments above but our team's desire to further develop
NDN by using it for our everyday communication.

This technical report provides background information on the {\bf Open mHealth}
network environment including key application challenges faced using
IP and describes the design for a pilot application that the NDN team is 
building.  It serves as the primary design document for this application. 

\subsection{Open mHealth Background}

Mobile health (mHealth) has emerged as both an important commercial
market and a key area of Health IT, a national priority. The 2013 mHealth
Summit
%\footnote{\url{http://www.mhealthsummit.org/about-summit/overview}} 
will host over 4,500 participants.  Recent surveys suggest there are
over 13,000 health-related apps available to Apple iPhone
users, and over 6000 for Android users~\cite{Eng_Lee13}.  The 
Internet's role as a critical enabler of mHealth will grow further over
the next decade.

Mobile health continues our work in the first NSF-supported NDN project
on participatory sensing. 
To explore mHealth as a network environment for NDN, our team will
collaborate with the Open mHealth project~\cite{chen2012making}  led by
Deborah Estrin (Cornell) and Ida Sim (UC San Francisco). Within the many
applications of mobile technology to health, Open mHealth focuses on
leveraging the public's everyday mobile devices (cell phones, tablets,
etc.)~to extend evidence-based interventions beyond the reach of traditional
care and thereby improve disease management and prevention.  For
example, mobile applications exist or have been proposed to manage:
pre- and post-natal care of mothers~\cite{Gurman_etal12}; 
diabetes~\cite{Sieverdes_etal13,Tamrat_Kachnowski12}; 
everyday activity in stroke patients and others with chronic
disease~\cite{Dobkin_Dorsch11}; and community exposure to
environmental pollutants~\cite{Ramanathan20114481}.



The Open mHealth team envisions that the Internet will interconnect 1)
data capture, 2) secure storage, 3) modeling and analytics, and 4) user
interface components to create a modular, layered sense-making framework.  
Such applications will use low-level state
classifications of raw data (e.g., estimated activity states such as
sitting, walking, driving from continuous accelerometer and location
traces) to derive mid-level semantic features (e.g., total number of
ambulatory minutes, number of hours spent out of house), that can 
be mapped to behavioral biomarkers for specific diseases
(e.g., chronic pain, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, fatigue, depression,
etc)~\cite{Estrin_IPSN_2013}.


For example, Figure~\ref{fig:mHealth-diabetes} shows a network of open components
for self-care of diabetes, which affects 25.8M people in the U.S., 
less than half of whom meet recommended standards, such as blood
glucose index levels, for managing their own health. Type 1 diabetics
continuously self-monitor blood glucose and insulin levels, and
other important factors such as diet and exercise.  Many developers are
exploring mobile health technologies to assist self-monitoring and
diabetes management, since almost all
	%given that 85\% to 90\% of 
patients have access to
mobile health capable technology~\cite{Sieverdes_etal13}.   
	%current and envisioned 
But such applications often have proprietary or siloed
designs that inhibit data exchange, e.g., data streams from 
apps for blood glucose and physical activity do not easily
integrate,  %(especially by the patient).  This is 
a missed opportunity to
provide more comprehensive analysis and coaching to the patient and more
complete longitudinal data to providers.

\textbf{The Open mHealth team instead advocates an interoperable,  Internet-inspired
approach.} They propose a thin waist of open data interchange standards
that will enable an ecosystem of sensing, storage, analysis, and user
interface components to support medical
discovery and evidence-based care.  In the same way that the Internet's
IP layer enabled innovation and interoperability among distributed
devices, they believe a common and open approach to mHealth data exchange
will  encourage the emergence of a market-supported, patient-centered
landscape of innovative health applications. Central to this vision is
patient-controlled, privacy-aware data exchange across device, component,
and application boundaries.  The focus on \emph{data exchange as the
backbone of the application ecosystem} makes open mHealth an excellent
network environment to both drive and evaluate NDN.

\subsection{Challenges of IP}

\begin{itemize}
\item Locating endpoints to source/sink data.
\item Key pain point is OAuth 2.0:  Implementation relies on this – doesn’t scale to the DPU model and has numerous problems. 

When data are in transferring in the IP network, attackers can sniffer, copy and save all the data packets; after data are uploaded and saved in servers, attackers can hijack servers to get data. IP architecture proposed Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols \cite{dierks2008transport} to secure the connection between two hosts, and OAuth or OpenID\cite{recordon2006openid} protocol to ensure that storage servers only send data to authorized users. But there are still problems: once data are uploaded and to servers, producers can only rely on servers to protect the data's security; when servers are compromised, all the data on this server are compromised.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fit of NDN to Application Domain}
The following ideas about why NDN fits Open mHealth well should be validated through experimentation and directly influence the design goals found later in this document. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Like NDN, Open mHealth  focuses on \textbf{named data as the ``thin waist'' of interoperability}. As discussed above, the Open mHealth architecture focuses on data exchange rather than system interoperability. 
\item \textbf{Reduction in complexity for request-response architecture} should make interoperability across a wide ecosystem easier, and support low-capability devices directly - given that many apps run on a variety of types of devices. Using NDN rather than IP enables Open mHealth applications to be coded using data naming directly rather than having to create abstractions to translate data names to IP-based hosts providing services.
\item \textbf{Distributed storage is straightforward to implement on NDN}. Could drive a new data-diffusion focused model for this application.  We will explore how the application's storage architecture can be simplified and map closely to network architecture.  NDN naturally supports distributed storage, which can ease the burden of fault-tolerance and load-balancing in large networks, reducing cost-of-entry and fostering innovation. 
\item \textbf{Data-centric security requirements of Open mHealth are a good match for NDN}, and could be a major improvement over a current pain point – OAuth, in terms of ease of development and overall security. Because NDN does not rely on perimeter- or channel-based security, it can promote global health data ecosystems rather than previous walled garden approaches, if the ecosystem is designed directly.  In the long term, this shift has direct relevance for opt-in epidemiological studies in public health, by enabling researchers to draw from large populations who have elected to share some data with them. 
\item \textbf{Intrinsic disruption tolerance and multi-path support} are a good fit for mobile devices if challenges of mobile publishing can be addressed. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Collaboration}

The following team is collaborating on the design and development of this application: 

\begin{itemize}
\item UCLA REMAP - application design; library support; web-based visualization; values in design.
\item UCLA IRL - architecture implications; repository; library and forwarder support; trust and security. 
\item U. Arizona - forwarder support; NFD Android port. 
\item U. Michigan - trust and security.
\item Tsinghua - repository. 
\item Basel - data flow processing using NFN.
\item Anyang - Ohmage capture application port. 
\end{itemize}

Additionally, we will partner with the Open mHealth team -- both its leadership and
developers -- to understand the requirements and current state-of-the-art
in this network environment, as well as limitations they face from the
current Internet architecture. We will pick one or more 
applications (e.g., diabetes management or post-heart attack health management) 
that are representative of the envisioned ecosystem, and port existing software
of the Open mHealth team to the NDN architecture.  We will use an interactive
development process, soliciting regular feedback from the Open mHealth team.
