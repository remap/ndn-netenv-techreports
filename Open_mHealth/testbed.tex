\section{Testbed}

All components under development as part of NDNEx should connect and communicate through the NDN testbed. Some components may also support ad-hoc communication, but this is not a requirement. 

An instance of TCP/IP Ohmage (client and server) is now up and running thanks to Haitao in Lixiaâ€™s group at UCLA.
